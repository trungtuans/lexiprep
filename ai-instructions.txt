# Code refinement guidelines for maintaining clean, readable, and well-documented code

[Refine Code]
Review and refine the code following these guidelines:
- Apply best practices for naming functions and variables
- Fix grammar and spelling errors
- Remove unnecessary comments for trivial operations
- Add brief comments summarizing the file's purpose at the top
- Add concise comments before functions and important sections for future developers
- Maintain current logic without changing core functionality
